# Runbook

Often, I am tasked with ensuring the reliability of different applications and workloads. Many times, I haven't written the code and there is little to no documentation.

In order to provide a somewhat complete outline for later reference, I typically create a runbook so that I can understand the application myself.

This repository contains the outline of a basic runbook that when completed should give a decent understand about how to run an application.

I have found this useful for DevOps, SRE and Platform Engineering positions.
